# Design-Report-on-Two-Stage-Operational-Transconductance-Amplifier
Design and analysis of a low-power two-stage Miller-compensated operational amplifier in 180 nm CMOS, emphasizing stability and layout-aware analog design.
This work involved the design, simulation, and post-layout verification of a two-stage Miller-compensated operational amplifier in 180 nm CMOS technology, emphasizing low-power operation and stability. The design highlights fundamental analog trade-offs among gain, bandwidth, power, and layout parasitics, while demonstrating that ultra-low power consumption can be achieved with careful device sizing and compensation. Post-layout analysis revealed significant performance degradation due to parasitics, reinforcing the necessity of layout-aware design and adequate design margins. Overall, the project provides practical insight into real-world analog IC design, compensation techniques, and the critical impact of layout on circuit performance.
